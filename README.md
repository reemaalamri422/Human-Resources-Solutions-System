# Human-Resources-Solutions-System
Human Resources Solutions System is a system that provides a platform to manage the hiring process of a group of qualified cleaning-workers and drivers on an hourly basis. The human resources management system will begin with 10 employees (cleaning-workers and drivers). However, as a future plan, it will be expanded to reach 100 employeesâ€™ records.
